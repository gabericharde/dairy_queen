This repository contains python code to calculate all possible "double dips" for
a specified set of show times, according to specified parameters.

A double dip (really, an _n_ dip) is just a fancy (non-technical) term to mean
a sequence of movies. You may know this by another term, but if you've ever
gone to the movies and seen two films in sequence, you've double dipped.

Now, extend this to _n_ films, back-to-back, and you've just completed an
n-dip...
